This is danger for food secuirty but still many goverments dont care or just ignore until is too late.\n",

And birds dont know when to migrate cause the season mix up, spring come late but also early sometimes. Its confusing. Human people also feel it, like heatwave kill many persons in city, and old people and babys get sick more. The sea level also is rising, and some island might be disappear under water completly, imagine that happen to ur home!\n",
